qr0,,,"Witch Hazel, Hamamelis vernalis",Behind McCabe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Quakers relied on networks to maintain the faith spread across a large area in the 17th and 18th centuries, but they also used these networks to share spiritual messages, news, and botanical specimens. Some Friends involved include names we know, like John Bartram, but we’re going to meet a few more today. Bartram’s most regular English correspondent was Peter Collinson, a London Quaker. They traded plants and seeds regularly and it was through Bartram that Collinson introduced witch botanical hazel to England. Actually, Collinson is credited with having introduced nearly 200 new species of plant into Britain. He started collecting seeds as a young man and an early letter of his describes his botanical adventures as escapes ‘from the hurrys of the town to breathe the air of content and quiet’. His work with plants was recognized and Collinson became a fellow of the Royal Society, of which he remained a fellow for 40 years. He played a key role in providing British collectors with plants from abroad, especially from America. He was responsible for introducing nearly 200 new species of plant into Britain. He also corresponded with and wrote scientific papers with Linnaeus and Benjamin Franklin, as well as Sir Hans Sloane, whose collections were the basis of the British Museum and the British Library. Some plants introduced to Britain by Collinson include Silver Maples, Azaleas, Richweed - Collinsonia canadensis, Smooth Hydrangea , Siberian lily - Lilium pensylvanicum, Wild Sweet William, Rhododendron, Poison Ivy, Elderberry, and Viburnum dentatum (which we will talk about later).","Darlington, William, and Peter Collinson.

qr1,,,American Elm,Behind McCabe,,,,,,,,compound_object,,,,,,"There is a legend of a treaty between the Lenni Lenape and William Penn taking place under an elm, the Treaty Tree at Shackamaxon, in 1682. Despite no written record of this happening under an elm, the council by Penn's Elm became iconic. In the 1870s that elm was immortalized in the Frieze of American History in the Rotunda of the US Capitol. Benjamin West painted it in his 1771 painting and Edward Hicks included the ‘Treaty Elm’ in many of his 62 Peaceable Kingdoms in the 19th century. The elm itself fell in a gale in 1810, and there were actual eulogies in newspapers around the country. Souvenir hunters snatched bits of the tree until all that was left was the trunk. Horticulturists took cuttings that grew into second-generation trees. And Penn Treaty Park, which the City of Philadelphia opened in 1894. If I can reference an article written by Jared Farmer in 2019 Journal of American History: the celebrations and veneration of the Treaty Elm references Indigenous tree culture. Farmer wrote that ‘The early tree-themed peace medals from colonial Pennsylvania owed as much to native symbology as European’. Farmer wrote about The Hiawatha wampum belt of the Haudenosaunee —and its oral constitution— which featured the tree under which Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas came to agreement. While the treaty itself has become associated with the theft of Native lands by colonizers, the symbol of the elm is connected to peace.","Charles Smith Ogden family Papers, RG5-108: a leaf and bark from Penn's Treaty Elm.

He was born in 1722 in Chester County, was educated to the age of 12 in stonemasonry, then worked as a farmer. He became interested in the natural world and started to collect books on the topic and specimens. By 1764, he had accumulated enough land and wealth that he had a greenhouse and an observatory. By 1785, he had published, Arbustrum Americanum, one of if not the first published work on just botany. In a 1935 article about Marshall, Francis Pennell described him as, ‘One can imagine the man of middle years, after his long hours of farm work, finding time to make nearly all its descriptions from actual living plants in his garden or in the woods of Chester County. Each genus and each species received a short but clear account…’ Called by some the ""Father of American Dendrology"", Marshall corresponded with Peter Collinson (who we talked about earlier) and John Fothergill (who we will talk about more), both of them in England. He also exchanged letters with Sir Hans Sloane. Paw Paw is native and Marshall found it during his studies of Pennsylvania plantlife for Arbustrum Americanum. He noted that ‘This grows common in rich bottoms or by river sides, in Pennsylvania… The fruit is often found growing two or three together, which soon falls off, becomes very mellow and turns of a yellow color'.

To many historians, he is known for having served as a Democratic-Republican member of the House of Representatives from 1819 to 1823. In the plant sciences, Darlington is known for being Humphry Marshall's biographer and an amateur botanist. He wrote a lot about the plants Marshall placed about his home, as well as about plants in Chester County. For Darlington, studying the natural world was an important human activity. He wrote, ‘It is impossible for any one, endowed with the common attributes of humanity, to avoid being something of a Naturalist’. And like many of us, he felt that ‘There is a calm delight in the contemplation of Plants and Flowers, which is never felt - and can never be appreciated - by those who find their chief gratification in the turmoils and commotions of the animal world’. In his 1837 book, Flora cestrica: an attempt to enumerate and describe the flowering and filicoid plants of Chester County in the state of Pennsylvania, he wrote about White Oak, saying, 'This is one of our finest and most valuable forest trees - often attaining to an enormous size… The bark is astringent and tonic - while the acorns are sweet and nutritious, affording a favorite food for swine'. Darlington referred to oaks, in general, as a noble genus. The pride and ornament of our American forests’.","Darlington Family Papers, RG5-296",,,
